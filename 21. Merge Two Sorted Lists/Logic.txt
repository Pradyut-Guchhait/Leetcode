Detailed Logic:

1.Dummy Node Initialization:
*A dummy node is created as a placeholder to easily handle edge cases (like when one of the input lists is empty). The dummy node doesnâ€™t hold any significant value (val = 0), and its primary role is to serve as a starting point for the merged list.

2.Current Pointer:
*The current pointer starts at the dummy node and will be used to build the merged list by linking nodes from l1 and l2.

3.Merge Process:
*The while loop continues as long as both l1 and l2 have nodes left to process.
*Inside the loop:
	If l1->val < l2->val, the node from l1 is attached to the merged list, and l1 moves to its next node.
	Otherwise, the node from l2 is attached to the merged list, and l2 moves to its next node.
*After attaching the chosen node, the current pointer is moved forward to the newly added node.

4.Handling Remaining Nodes:
*After the loop, one of the lists (l1 or l2) might still have remaining nodes (because the other list is fully traversed).
*The line current->next = l1 ? l1 : l2; attaches the remaining nodes from the non-empty list directly to the merged list.

5.Return the Merged List:
*The merged list starts right after the dummy node, so the function returns dummy->next, which is the head of the merged list.

@Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider two linked lists:

l1 = [1, 2, 4]
l2 = [1, 3, 4]
Initial State:

dummy -> 0 -> null
current = dummy
Iteration 1:

Compare l1->val = 1 with l2->val = 1.
Attach the node from l2 (either can be attached since they are equal).
Move current to this new node.
Move l2 to l2->next.
Iteration 2:

Compare l1->val = 1 with l2->val = 3.
Attach the node from l1.
Move current to this new node.
Move l1 to l1->next.
Continue similarly until one of the lists is fully traversed. Finally, attach any remaining nodes from the non-empty list.

Final Merged List:

dummy -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> null
Return dummy->next as the head of the merged list, which gives [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4].


Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes in l1 and m is the number of nodes in l2. Each node is processed exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(1), since the merging is done in-place, and only a few pointers are used for tracking nodes.
