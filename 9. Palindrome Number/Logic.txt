Detailed Explanation:

1.Negative Numbers Check:
*The first condition if (x < 0) return false; handles negative numbers. Since negative numbers cannot be palindromes (e.g., -121 is not the same as 121-), the function immediately returns false for any negative input.

2.Reversing the Number:
*The variable n stores the original number x.
*The while (n) loop iterates as long as n is not zero.
*In each iteration:
	d = n % 10; extracts the last digit of n.
	k = k * 10 + d; appends this digit to k, effectively building the reversed number digit by digit.
	n = n / 10; removes the last digit from n.

3.Overflow Check:
*The line if (k > (0x7fffffff - d) / 10) return false; ensures that adding the digit d to k does not cause an overflow.
*0x7fffffff is the hexadecimal representation of the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed integer, which is 2147483647. If adding d to k * 10 would exceed this limit, the function returns false because it would lead to an incorrect result.

4.Palindrome Check:
*After the loop finishes, the function compares the reversed number k with the original number x.
*If they are the same (k == x), the function returns true, indicating that x is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns false.

@Example Walkthrough:
*Let's say x = 121:
*Initial n = 121, k = 0
*Iteration 1: d = 1, k = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1, n = 121 / 10 = 12
*Iteration 2: d = 2, k = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12, n = 12 / 10 = 1
*Iteration 3: d = 1, k = 12 * 10 + 1 = 121, n = 1 / 10 = 0
*k is now 121, which equals the original number x, so the function returns true.


Complexity:
*Time Complexity: O(log(x)), where x is the input number. The loop runs for each digit in the number, which is proportional to the number of digits (logarithmic in terms of the number of digits).
*Space Complexity: O(1), as the solution uses only a fixed amount of extra space for the variables n, d, and k.


Edge Cases:
Single-digit numbers (e.g., 7) are palindromes since they read the same forward and backward.
Numbers that end in zero (e.g., 10) are not palindromes unless they are zero itself (e.g., 0).
Overflow is handled carefully, ensuring the solution remains within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer.
