Solution:

The most efficient solution involves using a hash map (dictionary) to track the indices of the numbers as you iterate through the list. Here’s a simple explanation:

1.Create a hash map to store the number and its index.
2.Iterate through the list of numbers. For each number, calculate the difference between the target and the current number.
3.Check if this difference is already in the hash map. If it is, you’ve found the two numbers that add up to the target.
4.If the difference is not in the hash map, add the current number and its index to the hash map.


Explanation of the code:

*Create an unordered_map numMap: This will store each number and its index as you iterate through the array.
*Loop through the nums array: For each element:
*Calculate the complement needed to reach the target when added to the current element.
*Check if the complement exists in numMap. If it does, return the indices of the current element and the complement.
*If the complement is not found, store the current element and its index in numMap for future reference.
*Return {} if no solution is found, which should not happen in this problem because it's guaranteed there is exactly one solution.
