Initialize Variables:
alen and blen store the lengths of the input binary strings a and b.
s is a temporary string used to pad zeros if the strings are of unequal length.

Equalize the Length of the Strings:
If the length of a is greater than b, pad b with zeros on the left to make its length equal to a.
If the length of b is greater than a, pad a with zeros on the left to match the length of b.

Binary Addition from Right to Left:
Now that both strings are of the same length, you start adding the binary digits from right to left (least significant bit to most significant bit).
In each iteration, the sum is calculated by:
Converting a[i] and b[i] from characters ('0' or '1') to integers (0 or 1).
Adding the corresponding bits from a and b along with the carry from the previous step.
The result of the current bit (sum % 2) is prepended to the result string ans.
The carry for the next iteration is calculated as sum / 2.

Handling the Carry:
After the loop, if there's still a carry left, it means an additional 1 should be added to the front of the result string ans.

Return the Result:
The final binary sum is stored in the string ans, which is returned as the result.

Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider an example where a = "1010" and b = "1011".
Initial State:

a = "1010"
b = "1011"
carry = 0
After padding, both strings are of equal length.
Step-by-Step Addition:

Iteration 1 (i = 3):

a[3] = 0, b[3] = 1, carry = 0.
Sum = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.
ans = "1", carry = 0.
Iteration 2 (i = 2):

a[2] = 1, b[2] = 1, carry = 0.
Sum = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.
ans = "01", carry = 1 (since sum = 2).
Iteration 3 (i = 1):

a[1] = 0, b[1] = 0, carry = 1.
Sum = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.
ans = "101", carry = 0.
Iteration 4 (i = 0):

a[0] = 1, b[0] = 1, carry = 0.
Sum = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.
ans = "0101", carry = 1.

Final Step:
After the loop, carry = 1, so prepend "1" to the result.
ans = "10101".
The final result is "10101".

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(max(n, m)), where n is the length of string a and m is the length of string b. The algorithm iterates through the longest string.
Space Complexity: O(max(n, m)), because the result string can be at most one character longer than the longest input string (due to possible carry).
