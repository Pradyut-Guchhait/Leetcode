Detailed Logic:

1.Initialize Values:
*value: This will store the final integer result.
*prev_value: Tracks the value of the previous Roman numeral character.
*current_value: Holds the value of the current Roman numeral character being processed.

2.Mapping Roman Numerals:
*An array roman_values[128] is used to map the ASCII values of Roman numeral characters to their respective integer values. This allows for quick lookup of each character's value during iteration.

3.Iterate Through the Roman Numeral String:
*The loop iterates over each character in the Roman numeral string s.

4.Determine Whether to Add or Subtract:
*Addition: If the prev_value is greater than or equal to current_value, simply add current_value to value.
*Subtraction: If prev_value is smaller than current_value, this means a subtraction situation (like IV or IX). *In this case, add current_value and subtract 2 * prev_value. Subtracting twice the prev_value corrects the earlier addition of prev_value (from the previous iteration) and accounts for the subtraction rule in Roman numerals.

5.Update prev_value:
*After processing each character, prev_value is updated to the current_value for the next iteration.

6.Return the Result:
*After the loop completes, value holds the integer equivalent of the Roman numeral string, which is then returned.


@Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the Roman numeral XIV (which should convert to 14):
*Start with value = 0, prev_value = 0.
*Iteration 1: s[i] = 'X', current_value = 10. Since prev_value = 0 is less than current_value = 10, add 10 to value, making value = 10. Update prev_value = 10.
*Iteration 2: s[i] = 'I', current_value = 1. Since prev_value = 10 is greater than current_value = 1, add 1 to value, making value = 11. Update prev_value = 1.
*Iteration 3: s[i] = 'V', current_value = 5. Since prev_value = 1 is less than current_value = 5, add 5 - 2 * 1 = 3 to value, making value = 14. Update prev_value = 5.

*The final result is 14, which is the correct integer value for the Roman numeral XIV.


Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string. Each character is processed exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(1), since the function uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
