Detailed Explanation:

1.Variables Initialization:
*n is used to store the last digit of x as we extract it.
*rev is initialized to 0 and will store the reversed integer.

2.Loop for Reversing the Integer:
*The loop runs until x becomes 0.
*In each iteration:
	^n = x % 10; extracts the last digit of x.
	^x = x / 10; removes the last digit from x.
	^rev = rev * 10 + n; appends the extracted digit n to the current rev.
*This effectively reverses the digits of x.

3.Overflow Handling:
*After reversing, the code checks whether rev is within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer. The valid range for a 32-bit signed integer is from -2^31 (INT_MIN = -2147483648) to 2^31 - 1 (INT_MAX = 2147483647).
*If rev is outside this range, the function returns 0, as the problem requires.

4.Return the Result:
*If rev is within the valid range, the function returns rev.

Edge Cases:
*Negative Numbers: The code handles negative numbers automatically because the sign is preserved by the operations performed (x % 10 and x / 10 work correctly with negative numbers).
*Overflow: The use of long long int for rev helps in detecting overflow before converting it back to int.
*Trailing Zeros: Trailing zeros in the original number (e.g., 120) are naturally removed by the reversal process.

Complexity:
*Time Complexity: O(log(x)), where x is the number of digits in the input. The loop runs for each digit.
*Space Complexity: O(1), as only a few variables are used for computation, with no additional data structures required.
