It works by merging the two arrays into a single sorted array, then calculating the median from the merged array. Hereâ€™s an explanation and some comments:

Explanation:

1.Merging Two Arrays:
*You create a new array, mergedArray, to hold the elements of both input arrays nums1 and nums2.
*Two pointers, i and j, are used to traverse nums1 and nums2, respectively.
*The elements from both arrays are compared and the smaller element is placed into mergedArray.

2.Handling Remaining Elements:
*After one of the arrays is fully traversed, any remaining elements in the other array are copied to mergedArray.

3.Finding the Median:
*If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
*If odd, the median is the middle element of the merged array.

4.Memory Management:
*After computing the median, the dynamically allocated memory for mergedArray is freed to prevent memory leaks.
