Detailed Logic:

1.Initial Check:
*If the input array nums is empty (nums.size() == 0), the function returns 0 immediately, since there are no elements to process.

2.Index Tracking (ind):
*A variable ind is initialized to 1. This variable tracks the position in the array where the next unique element should be placed.
*The first element is always unique, so we start with ind = 1.

3.Iterating Through the Array:
*A for loop starts from the second element (i = 1) and goes through the rest of the array.
	Inside the loop:
		^Duplicate Check: If the current element nums[i] is equal to the previous element nums[i-1], 		it means it's a duplicate, and the loop simply continues to the next iteration.
		^Unique Element: If nums[i] is not equal to nums[i-1], it's a unique element. It should be 		placed in the position indicated by ind. The ind index is then incremented by 1.

4.Erase Redundant Elements:
*After the loop, ind will be the index of the first redundant element. The function uses nums.erase(nums.begin() + ind, nums.end()) to remove all elements from this index to the end of the array. *These are the leftover duplicates that are no longer needed.

5.Return the New Length:
*Finally, the function returns nums.size(), which gives the new length of the array containing only unique elements.


@Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider an example with nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]:

Initial State:

nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
ind = 1
Iteration 1 (i = 1):

nums[1] == nums[0] (both are 1), so continue without doing anything.
Iteration 2 (i = 2):

nums[2] != nums[1] (2 vs. 1), so nums[ind] = nums[2] (i.e., nums[1] = 2).
Increment ind to 2.
nums now looks like [1, 2, 2, 2, 3].
Iteration 3 (i = 3):

nums[3] == nums[2] (both are 2), so continue without doing anything.
Iteration 4 (i = 4):

nums[4] != nums[3] (3 vs. 2), so nums[ind] = nums[4] (i.e., nums[2] = 3).
Increment ind to 3.
nums now looks like [1, 2, 3, 2, 3].
After the loop, ind = 3, so we erase elements from nums[3] onwards, leaving nums = [1, 2, 3].

The function returns 3, which is the new length of the array with unique elements.


Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element is processed once.
Space Complexity: O(1), as the function uses a constant amount of extra space.
