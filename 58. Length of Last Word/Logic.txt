Detailed Logic:
Initialize Variables:
i is initialized to s.size() - 1, which points to the last character in the string s.
length is initialized to 0, to keep track of the length of the last word.

Skip Trailing Spaces:
The first while loop skips any trailing spaces at the end of the string (if present). This is done by decrementing i until a non-space character is found.

Count the Length of the Last Word:
Once the trailing spaces are skipped, the second while loop counts the characters in the last word.
The loop continues until either a space is encountered (i.e., the end of the last word) or the beginning of the string is reached (i >= 0).
For each character that belongs to the last word (i.e., a non-space character), length is incremented, and i is decremented to move backward through the string.

Return the Result:
After the second loop completes, length contains the number of characters in the last word. The function returns this value.

Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider an example with s = "Hello World ".
Initial State:
s = "Hello World "
i = 12 (index of the last character)
length = 0

Step 1: Skip Trailing Spaces:
The first while loop skips spaces at the end.
After skipping, i = 10 (points to the last character 'd' of "World").

Step 2: Count the Last Word:
The second while loop counts the characters in the last word "World".
i = 10: s[10] == 'd', so length = 1, i = 9.
i = 9: s[9] == 'l', so length = 2, i = 8.
i = 8: s[8] == 'r', so length = 3, i = 7.
i = 7: s[7] == 'o', so length = 4, i = 6.
i = 6: s[6] == 'W', so length = 5, i = 5.

Step 3: Stop Counting:
The loop stops when i = 5 because s[5] == ' ' (a space is found).

Return the Result:
The function returns length = 5, which is the length of the last word "World".

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. The function processes each character at most once.
Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra space is used except for a few variables.
